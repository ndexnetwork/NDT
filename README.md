What is NDT?
NDT is a ERC-20 utility token on nDEX Network ecosystem. NDT will be used for profit distribution which start February 2019. NDT will be only exchangeable in nDEX Network’s own platform nEXBIT. More medium of exchange will be included in near future.

Distributions of NDT
As per plan there will be maximum 200,000 NDT emitted. All NDT will be produced/emitted for FREE public distribution or exchange with NDX. NDX:NDT ratio is 100000:1. All NDT is pegged at 5$ each. Every single wallet which have more than or equal 10m NDX is eligible to get maximum 400 NDT which worth 2000$ at pegged value. This reward distribution depends on few criteria, such as;

1. NDX holding age

2. NDX holding method

3. Community contribution

4. Wallet weight

nDEX Network doesn’t hold a single NDT.

All NDT will be produced/emitted for FREE public distribution or exchange with NDX. NDX:NDT ratio is 100000:1
Profit distribution with NDT
NDT is used for future nDEX Network’s profit distribution which conducted by a smart contract and paid in Ethereum. nDEX Network will distribute its 30% profit from gross earning every last week of a month which start February 2019. 1 NDT = 1 profit unit. Lets imagine at the month of March, nDEX Network (nDEX Market, BlockRoll & nEXBIT) 500 ETH then distribution will be from 1 NDT every holder get = (500*30%)/200000= 0.00075 ETH as a reward. If anyone hold 1000 NDT then reward will be = 0.75 ETH! Wow! Which will be a decent reward.

nDEX Network mid-term future plan
nDEX Network drives $NDX to cross-platform payment system as well as general use.

In the end of 2019 we move for Asia & Africa tour to settle our business in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Nigeria.
Our dream is to bring nDEX Network a real global decentralized company. Every NDT holder will play a decent role on future nDEX Network development.

Lets talk about NDX more, how does it play in nDEX Network ecosystem
1. If any client want to list their project nEXBIT for listing service and we charge him 10 ETH for donation & utility cost, he/she have to pay 60% ETH and 40% NDX at current rate and every time collection address will be same a smart contract which automatically burn 5% of collection.

2. Supply reduction is going on until 5b circulating supply, how many years does it take its not considerable fact.

3. Some of nEXBIT client want to draw a promo at nEXBIT platform even ICO, in this case his/her payment method is same as described earlier.

4. On every payable service, NDX will be included there & 5% burn will be a continuous process.

More details will be published near future after nEXBIT launch.
